## Features

- **Customizable Barrier Shapes:** Supports different shapes such as circles, rectangles, triangles, and cylinders.
- **Fluid Type Selection:** Allows simulation with different fluid types including water, oil, and air.
- **Real-Time Visualization:** Observe the dynamics of fluid flow as the simulation runs.
- **Color Customization:** Choose colors for barriers and fluid flow visualization.
- **Speed Control:** Adjust the speed of the simulation to suit different presentation or analysis needs.

## Installation

To run this simulation, you will need Python installed on your computer, along with several dependencies:

## Install Dependencies

pip install numpy matplotlib

## Technology Stack

- **Python:** The core programming language used.
- **Tkinter:** For creating the GUI.
- **NumPy:** Used for efficient numerical computations.
- **Matplotlib:** For rendering the simulation results and real-time visualization.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Tkinter (usually included with Python)

## Usage

To start the simulation, navigate to the project directory and run:
**python simulation.py**
Use the GUI to select the barrier shape, fluid type, simulation speed, and colors. Once configured, click "Start Simulation" to begin visualizing the fluid dynamics.
